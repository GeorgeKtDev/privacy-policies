  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 18, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Loomi</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") handles information when you use the Loomi mobile application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>App data:</strong> Loomi does <em>not</em> collect or store personal data from you. Your photos are processed locally on your device for review, sorting, and story creation. We do not upload your photos to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Accounts:</strong> Loomi does not require an account and does not collect names, emails, or profile information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
  <p>Loomi displays ads using <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. While we do not collect personal data ourselves, AdMob and its partners may process data (such as device identifiers and ad performance data) to provide, measure, and improve ads, in accordance with their own privacy policies and your device settings.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can manage ad preferences (e.g., limit ad tracking / reset advertising ID) in your device settings.</li>
    <li>Any data collected by AdMob is handled by Google and its partners under their respective policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>We do not operate a backend server for Loomi. The app does not upload your photos or store your personal information on our servers.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Loomi is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with a new "Last updated" date.</p>
